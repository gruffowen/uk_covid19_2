```

# Let's get started

First load the necessary packages (these contain the functions we will use) and the data. (Don't laugh at the file path - I forgot R Studio automatically creates a folder and by the time I remembered I couldn't correct it).

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(zoo)
library(ggthemes)

cases <- read.csv("2020-10-17/data_2020-Oct-17.csv")
```

What's the sum of new cases over the last week for which we have the full data (left of the arrow in the presentation) and the sum of cases over the week before?

```{r}
sum(cases[(8:14),5])

sum(cases[(15:21),5])
```

That's all I was doing with the uk data, I just use their charts which is a cop out really.

# More importantly - Wales

I do hope you will be impressed with this section though. First we load the data from Public Health Wales. Then tell the computer to treat 'Specimen.date' as a date. 

```{r}
w_cases <- read.csv("2020-10-17/Rapid COVID-19 surveillance data(1).csv", header=TRUE)
w_cases$Specimen.date <- 
  as.Date(w_cases$Specimen.date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```

Next pull out the data for Anglesey, Gwynedd and Conwy and put them in their own tables.

```{r}
a_cases <- filter(w_cases, Local.Authority == "Isle of Anglesey")

g_cases <- filter(w_cases, Local.Authority == "Gwynedd")

c_cases <- filter(w_cases, Local.Authority == "Conwy")
```

Next create a new dataframe where Conwy, Anglesey and Gwynedd each have their own columns, along with the testing episodes for each county.I just take the data from row 6 onwards, as turnaround times are 1-6 days (ish), so the data from the top rows is incomplete. Row 157 was the last row when I started doing it but the table gets longer each week (not near 65,000 rows yet though!) so this row number could (should) be updated.

```{r}
newdf2 <- data.frame("Specimen date" = c_cases$Specimen.date[6:157],
                    "Conwy" = c_cases$Cases..new.[6:157],
                    "Anglesey" = a_cases$Cases..new.[6:157],
                    "Gwynedd" = g_cases$Cases..new.[6:157],
                    "Conwy_episodes" = c_cases$Testing.episodes..new.[6:157],
                    "Anglesey_episodes" = a_cases$Testing.episodes..new.[6:157],
                    "Gwynedd_episodes" = g_cases$Testing.episodes..new.[6:157])
```

Add columns to the new dataframe for the AGC total and the rolling averages

```{r}
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("roll_mean_C" = rollmean(Conwy, 7, fill = NA))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("roll_mean_G" = rollmean(Gwynedd, 7, fill = NA))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("roll_mean_A" = rollmean(Anglesey, 7, fill = NA))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("AGC" = (Conwy+Anglesey+Gwynedd))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("roll_mean" = rollmean(AGC, 7, fill = NA))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("AGC_episodes" = (Conwy_episodes +
                             Anglesey_episodes+
                             Gwynedd_episodes))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("roll_mean_episodes" = rollmean(AGC_episodes, 7, fill = NA))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("Per_Positivity" = ((AGC/AGC_episodes)*100))
newdf2 <- newdf2 %>% 
  mutate("roll_mean_positivity" = rollmean(Per_Positivity, 7, fill = NA))
```

Make a lovely plot for Conwy
```{r warning=FALSE}
c_plot <- ggplot(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=Conwy))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue", color = "steelblue",
           width = 0.6)+
  labs(x = "Specimen date",
       y = "Conwy")+
  geom_line(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=roll_mean_C), 
            color = "royalblue4",
            size = 1)+
  ggtitle("Conwy cases by specimen date")

c_plot
```

Make a lovely plot for Gwynedd
```{r warning=FALSE}
g_plot <- ggplot(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=Gwynedd))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue", color = "steelblue",
           width = 0.6)+
  labs(x = "Specimen date",
       y = "Gwynedd")+
  geom_line(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=roll_mean_G), 
            color = "royalblue4",
            size = 1)+
  ggtitle("Gwynedd cases by specimen date")

g_plot
```

Make a lovely plot for Anglesey
```{r warning=FALSE}
a_plot <- ggplot(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=Anglesey))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue", color = "steelblue",
           width = 0.6)+
  labs(x = "Specimen date",
       y = "Anglesey")+
  geom_line(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=roll_mean_A), 
            color = "royalblue4",
            size = 1)+
  ggtitle("Anglesey cases by specimen date")

a_plot
```

Make a lovely plot for these 3 regions combined
```{r warning=FALSE}
agc_plot <- ggplot(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=AGC))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue", color = "steelblue",
           width = 0.6)+
  labs(x = "Specimen date",
       y = "Anglesey/Gwynedd/Conwy")+
  geom_line(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=roll_mean), 
            color = "royalblue4",
            size = 1)+
  ggtitle("Local cases by specimen date")

agc_plot
```

Make a lovely plot for AGC testing episodes
```{r warning=FALSE}
agc_episodes_plot <- ggplot(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=AGC_episodes))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue", color = "steelblue",
           width = 0.6)+
  labs(x = "Episode date",
       y = "Anglesey/Gwynedd/Conwy")+
  geom_line(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=roll_mean_episodes), 
            color = "royalblue4",
            size = 1)+
  ggtitle("Testing episodes by date")

agc_episodes_plot
```

Make a lovely plot for test positivity. I'm estimating positivity by doing ((AGC/AGC_episodes)*100) which isn't going to be totally right as it doesn't account for the same case being tested more than once but it's the best I can do.
```{r warning=FALSE}
agc_positivity <- ggplot(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y= Per_Positivity))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue", color = "steelblue",
           width = 0.6)+
  labs(x = "Episode date",
       y = "Anglesey/Gwynedd/Conwy")+
  geom_line(data = newdf2, aes(x=Specimen.date, y=roll_mean_positivity), 
            color = "royalblue4",
            size = 1)+
  ggtitle("Test % Positivity by date")

agc_positivity
```

THE END
